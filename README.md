The Ben Graham Centre for Value Investing Add-In

The BGCVI Add-In only works on Excel for Windows â€“ versions 2010 and 2007.

To install this Add-In in Excel 2007/2010 please follow the instructions in the following site: http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/installing-an-add-in-in-excel-2007/

To use any of the spreadsheets in this repository you will have to click the tab "Add-ins" in Excel and make sure you click "Remove Old Addins links".

I will add the Wikipedia page in the upcoming weeks.
