The Ben Graham Centre for Value Investing Add-In

The BGCVI Add-In works on Excel for Windows â€“ versions 2010 and 2007.

To install it please follow the instruction in the site: http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/installing-an-add-in-in-excel-2007/

To use any of the spreadsheets in this repository you will have to install the BGCVI Add-In and click "Remove Old Addins links" on the "Add-ins" tab in the Ribbon.

I will create the Wikipedia page in the upcoming weeks.
